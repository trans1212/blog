The 5 Pillars of Skycoin

## __1. SKYCOIN__

A truly decentralized, 51% attack proof, lightning quick cryptocurrency that was designed to fulfill Satoshi’s original vision.

## __2. SKYWIRE__

A mesh network that allows you to earn Skycoin for forwarding traffic/bandwidth. This is a similar to Tor or BitTorrent, except that you will be paid to participate.

## __3. SKYLEDGER__

A platform similar to Ethereum’s ERC20 platform, in the way a 2018 Bugatti Chiron is similar to a 1992 Geo Metro. They are both cars after all.

## __4. DECENTRALIZED APPS__

An ecosystem of apps being built on top of the previous three things.

## __5. SKYMINERS__
Our very own hardware platform. The Backbone which supports it all.
